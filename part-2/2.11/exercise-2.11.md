I have introduced containers in my project Kickeridoo50.

The URL for the repo: https://github.com/keviinx/kickeridoo50
Link to the instruction for running the project in a container: https://github.com/keviinx/kickeridoo50#using-as-docker-container

I have also placed a copy of the docker-compose.yml in the directory.
